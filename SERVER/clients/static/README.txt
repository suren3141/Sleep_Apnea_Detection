ignore all other folders.
The pages you need are in the pages folder.
Use add device page to insert to database.	// You must do this
Use the device list page to query database and fill table. 	// You must do this.
There may be some problems with sidebar.
If so just directly open the pages without relying on the side bar.

The patients table should be similar to the device thing, so we can do this later.

The login page is a seperate html file.
Use this to do the login.

// First finish the ones above before coming here
Other things to do:
- Graph
- Django rest for device auth
